# Simple Button (HTML + CSS)

This is a basic styled **Submit** button created using HTML and CSS.  
The focus of this project was to understand button styling, hover effects, transitions, and shadows.


## ðŸ§¾ Description

The button is designed with clean styling and subtle interaction when hovered.  
It includes padding, border-radius, hover effects, shadows, and smooth transitions â€” all using only CSS.

## ðŸ“˜ What I Learned

- How to **center a button** using Flexbox (`display: flex`, `justify-content`, `align-items`).
- Importance of **padding** to make buttons look spacious and user-friendly.
- Use of **`font-weight`** to adjust text boldness.
- How **`box-shadow`** can give depth and elevation to the button.
- Use of **`transition`** to make hover effects smooth and visually pleasing.
- Role of **`:hover` pseudo-class** to enhance interactivity.
- Use of **`transform: translateY()`** to create a subtle "lift" effect when hovering.
- Used **`display: inline-block`** to ensure the button behaves correctly in layout.

## ðŸ’¡ Purpose

The purpose of this mini project was to get comfortable with essential CSS button properties and build visually appealing, interactive buttons using pure HTML and CSS â€” no JavaScript involved.
